# flypy

Developed by Will Graham and Thomas Kajder

<hr>

This project has been made in order to make searching for cheap flights easier by way of [Google Flights API](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/)

Contains information from [OpenFlights Airport Database](http://openflights.org/data.html), which is made available here under the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) (ODbL).

<hr>

Currently the project supports searching and sorting of flights for a single day. We had intended to support fuzzy date searching and round-trip/mutliple-leg flights.

This project was stopped short of its original intended goals due to API limitations.
